# Kick-Offs

## Why 
When developers pick up stories, they might not get the full meaning due to imperfections in written human language. If they just start writing code based on a quick skim of even the best written story, they may head in the wrong direction.

Kick offs help mitigate this. They serve as the conversation that marries understanding between devs & business people. They give the two groups a common language and vision around what piece of work is being developed.

## What
A five to fifteen minute conversation, usually at the developer’s desk, including the product owner / story writer who wrote the story (or at least one who understands it), a QA from the squad, and if this is a user interface story, a designer. 

## How
Just prior to a dev or dev pair picking up a story, they should rally the troops and start a conversation. This conversation could start with the developers paraphrasing back what they think the story means, asking designers how an interaction might go, and getting feedback from QA around what edge cases might be difficult to test. These interactions can happen in any particular order, as long as the group walks away from the conversation with a shared understanding.

Everybody should be trying to think of probing questions that will help expose any misunderstanding. Sometimes, this will expose a gap in knowledge or an edge case that hadn’t yet been thought of. That’s okay! People will be in the conversation who can take away those gaps, get them covered, and take ownership for updating the story card, if necessary.

## Who 
@qa, @product-owners, @developers, @designers
